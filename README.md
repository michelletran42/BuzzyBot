<b>BuzzyBot</b>

We're tackling the issue of college students drinking past their personal limits. We envision that this helpful chatbot will allow college students and spirit enthusiasts to practice safe and responsible drinking while maintaining a nice buzz. It's a quick and simple tool that one can use while on the way to a party or a bar.

BuzzyBot teaches you about responsible drinking by calculating your blood alcohol content (BAC) based on your sex, weight, how long you plan to drink, and how much you plan to drink. BuzzyBot also calculates the number of drinks for an optimal buzz and allows you to compare the BAC for that amount to that of your own estimation.

Built using Node.js, Visual Studio, and Microsoft's Bot Framework.
